Next.js 15 is here, and it brings some exciting changes that are worth exploring. Let me walk you through the highlights.

## Turbopack is Stable

The biggest news is that Turbopack is now stable for local development. This means:

- **Faster builds** - Up to 96% faster local server startup
- **Faster HMR** - Changes reflect almost instantly
- **Better DX** - Less waiting, more coding

```bash
# It's now the default for dev
npx next dev
```

## React 19 Support

Next.js 15 is the first major framework to support React 19 out of the box:

- **Actions** - Server and client actions are now first-class
- **Use** - The new `use` hook for promises and contexts
- **Server Components** - Further improvements and optimizations

## Partial Prerendering

One feature I'm particularly excited about is **Partial Prerendering (PPR)**:

```tsx
export const experimental_ppr = true;

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main>
      <StaticHeader />
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        <DynamicContent />
      </Suspense>
    </main>
  );
}
```

This allows you to have static shells with dynamic content, combining the best of both worlds.

## Should You Upgrade?

If you're starting a new project, absolutely use Next.js 15. For existing projects, test thoroughly—especially if you're using custom configurations.
