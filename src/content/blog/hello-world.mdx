Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts, learnings, and experiences as a developer.

## Why I'm Starting a Blog

I've been developing for a while now, and I've realized that writing about what I learn helps me:

1. **Solidify my understanding** - Teaching is the best way to learn
2. **Track my progress** - It's nice to look back and see how far I've come
3. **Connect with others** - The dev community is amazing and I want to be part of it

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Web Development** - React, Next.js, TypeScript, and modern frontend techniques
- **Design** - UI/UX thoughts, accessibility, and making things look good
- **Career** - Lessons learned, tips for other developers
- **Projects** - Walkthroughs of things I'm building

## A Quick Code Example

Here's a simple React component to show how code looks in my posts:

```tsx
function Greeting({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Hello, {name}!</h1>
      <p className="text-gray-600">Welcome to my blog.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Let's Connect

Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com). I love meeting fellow developers!
